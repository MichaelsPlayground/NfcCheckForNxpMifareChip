# NFC Check for NXP Mifare Chip technologie

This app does only check if a NXP NFC chip is build in the device. If the chip is available you can 
use Mifare Ultralight and Mifare Classic NFC tags with your device.

You do not need a tag for checking as the app checks for the Mifare class on your Android SDK.
